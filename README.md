# WaneEngine
A novice chess engine, written in Lua.

This is my first attempt at creating a chess engine program. I chose Lua, as I am fairly comfortable with the language, and have been learning the ins and outs of chess engines.

Currently the engine is still incomplete, and the board representation and move generation are only partly functional.
