# WaneEngine
A novice chess engine, written in Lua.

This is my first attempt at creating a chess engine program. I chose Lua, as I am fairly comfortable with the language, and have been learning the ins and outs of chess engines.

## Chess Program
This is also used as the source of board representation in my chess Gui program at https://github.com/HalflingHelper/Chess.
